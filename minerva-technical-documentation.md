## Overview

This project implements an unsupervised learning technique that uses a neural network and processes multiple hours of video as input. This unsupervised learning technique does automatic feature detection & generates a feature selector neural network. 
The feature selector neural network is then trained using labeled images to obtain a neural network capable of classification. The labeled dataset used for training was obtained from http://www.kaggle.com/c/multi-modal-gesture-recognition

## 1. Unsupervised Learning
Automatic feature selection or 'deep learning' is a problem that has recently received a lot of attention. As the amount of data available to run the Machine Learning algorithm grows constantly, this problem of manually labeling input data becomes more acute. Thus, the need for systems that can automatically detect features becomes more apparent. This project accomplishes 'deep learning' a.k.a 'automatic feature selection' by implementing the Sparse Autoencoder described in http://stanford.edu/class/cs294a/sparseAutoencoder.pdf The main idea .......
