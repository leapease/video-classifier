This project implements an unsupervised learning technique that uses a neural network and processes multiple hours of video as input. This unsupervised learning technique does automatic feature detection & generates a feature selector neural network. 
This neural network is then trained using labeled images to obtain a neural network capable of classification. The labeled dataset used for training was obtained from http://www.kaggle.com/c/multi-modal-gesture-recognition
